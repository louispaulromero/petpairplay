It isn’t just hairballs; it’s often triggered by illness (dental, kidney), stress/pain/heat, or a low-fiber, high-carb diet. When rabbits stop eating, gut pH shifts and gas-producing bacteria bloom—causing painful gas and toxins. Treat this as urgent.</p>\n    <figure class=\"step-media\">\n      <img src=\"/assets/article-2-img1.png\" alt=\"Illustration related to GI stasis causes and gut gas buildup\">\n    </figure>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>See a vet promptly</strong><br>\n    Vets confirm with exam + X-rays (often gas-filled stomach/cecum) and bloodwork (dehydration/electrolytes). They may check teeth for points/abscesses. Treatment typically includes fluids for rehydration, syringe feeding for nutrition, pain control, anti-inflammatories, and—when the rabbit is producing stool—motility drugs. Antibiotics are used if there’s a bacterial infection. Hospitalization may be recommended depending on severity.</p>\n    <figure class=\"step-media\">\n      <img src=\"/assets/article-2-img2.png\" alt=\"X-ray/clinic style visual to represent diagnosis and treatment\">\n    </figure>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>Prevent recurrence</strong><br>\n    Feed a hay-based, high-fiber diet with leafy greens; limit pellets to about <strong>1 tbsp per kg</strong> of ideal body weight per day. Remove calorie-dense treats; keep fruit rare. Reduce pellets gradually over a week (no crash dieting), add daily supervised exercise/enrichment, and keep the bottom clean while weight comes off. Ask your vet/vet nurse for a personalized plan and regular checks.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

Wait <strong>2–4 weeks</strong> post-surgery for healing and hormones to settle (males may remain fertile up to six weeks). Set up a <strong>neutral space</strong> that neither bun claims. Gather gloves/towel, a spray bottle to pre-empt scuffles, and keep first sessions short (5–15 min).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>First sessions in neutral territory</strong><br>\n    Use spaces unlike the resident bun’s area (bathroom, empty tub, friend’s home, garage, or a pen in a new room). Keep areas controllable with no trap corners. Start side-by-side housing in separate enclosures placed near each other so they can see/smell without contact.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>Read behaviors & guide gently</strong><br>\n    <em>Tentative friendship</em> (sniffing, sitting near) is common. <em>Mounting</em> can be normal dominance as long as the submissive rabbit tolerates it—ensure faces are visible to avoid bites. Brief <em>chasing</em> may occur; watch closely and interrupt <em>before</em> escalation (quick spritz or a calm reset). Avoid full fights; negative events can set bonding back. If needed, short, mildly novel experiences (e.g., laundry basket on a running dryer or a short car ride) can help them associate each other with safety.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>Progress, setbacks, and aftercare</strong><br>\n    Work daily for at least 15 minutes; increase duration as tolerance improves. Expect ups and downs. Until fully bonded, keep them <strong>separate when unsupervised</strong>. Once bonded, <strong>do not separate</strong>—take both to the vet together so scent/health changes don’t trigger rejection. Give equal attention, avoid favorites, and end sessions on a positive note whenever possible.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>"

Excess weight strains the heart, worsens arthritis, and makes self-grooming hard. A dirty backside can lead to flystrike in warm weather—an emergency. Take weight concerns seriously.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>Check body condition (BCS 1–5)</strong><br>\n    Feel—don’t just look. You should feel ribs under a firm muscle layer (like a pocket of pens), not sharp like rulers (too thin) and not buried (too fat). Big dewlaps, fat pads, pot belly, or looking wider than long suggest overweight. Ideal is <strong>BCS 3/5</strong>.</p>\n    <figure class=\"step-media\">\n      <img src=\"/assets/article-4-img1.png\" alt=\"Body condition score illustration for rabbits\">\n    </figure>\n  </li>\n  <li class=\"step\">\n    <p><strong>Healthy plan & prevention</strong><br>\n    Switch to a hay-based, high-fiber diet with daily greens; limit pellets to about <strong>1 tbsp per kg</strong> of <em>ideal</em> body weight per day.
